\description{
Function calling directly the C++ routines that compute exact p-value for the (weighed) two-sample one- or two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic \eqn{P(D_{m,n} \ge q)}{}, at a fixed \eqn{q}{}, \eqn{q\in [0,1]}{}, given the sample sizes \code{m} and \code{n}, the vector-formed weight \code{w\_vec} and repeated times \code{M} for each distinct observation appeared in the pooled sample.

\usage{KS2sample_Rcpp(m, n, kind, M, q, w_vec, tol)}
\arguments{
  \item{m}{
  the sample size of first tested sample.
}
  \item{n}{
  the sample size of second tested sample.
}
  \item{kind}{
  An Integer value (= 1,2 or 3) which specified the alternative hypothesis. When = 1 specifies the test as two-sided test. When = 2 or 3 specify the test as one-sided test. See \sQuote{Details} for the meaning of the possible values. Other value is invalid.
  }
  \item{M}{
  an \eqn{1}{}-dimensional integer-valued vector with \eqn{K}{} cells, where \eqn{K}{} denotes the number of distinct values in the ordered pooled sample of tested pair of samples(i.e. \eqn{A_1<A_2<\ldots<A_K}{}). \code{M[i]} is the number of times that \eqn{A_i}{} has repeated in the pooled sample. A valid \code{M} must have strictly positive integer values and have the sum of all cells equals to \code{m+n}.
  }
  \item{q}{
  numeric value between 0 and 1, at which the p-value \eqn{P(D_{m,n}>q)}{} is computed.
  }
  \item{w_vec}{an 1-dimensional vector with \code{m+n-1} cells, giving weights to each observations besides the last in the pooled sample. Valid \code{w_vec} must have \code{m+n-1} cells and strictly positive value. See \sQuote{Details} for the meaning of values in each cell.
  }
  \item{tol}{the value of \eqn{\epsilon}{} for computing \eqn{P(D_{m,n} \geq{}q+ \epsilon)}{}, non-positive value and large value (\code{tol>1e-6}) is replaced by default \code{tol=1e-6}. In cases when \code{m} and \code{n} have large least common multiple, a smaller value is highly recommended.

\details{
Given a pair of random samples \eqn{(X_{1},..., X_{m})}{} and \eqn{(Y_{1},..., Y_{n})}{} of sizes \code{m} and \code{n} with empirical cdfs \eqn{F_{m}(t)}{} and \eqn{G_{n}(t)}{} respectively, coming from unknown CDFs \eqn{F(x)}{} and \eqn{G(x)}{}. It is assumed that \eqn{F(x)}{} and \eqn{G(x)}{} could be either \emph{continuous}, \emph{discrete} or \emph{mixed}, which means that repeated observations are allowed in the corresponding observed samples. We want to test the null hypothesis \eqn{H_0: F(x) = G(x)}{}  for all \eqn{x}{},  either against the alternative hypothesis \eqn{H_1: F(x)\neq G(x)}{}  for at least one \eqn{x}{}, which corresponds to the two-sided test, or against \eqn{H_1: F(x)> G(x)}{}  and \eqn{H_1: F(x)< G(x)}{}   for at least one \eqn{x}{}, which corresponds to the two one-sided tests. The (weighted) two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistics that are used to test these hypotheses are generally defined as:
\deqn{\Delta_{m,n} = \sup |F_{m}(t) - G_n(t)|W(E_{m+n}(t), \textnormal{ to test against the alternative } H_1: F(x)\neq G(x)}{} 
\deqn{\Delta_{m,n}^{+} = \sup [F_{m}(t) - G_n(x)]W(E_{m+n}(t)), \textnormal{ to test against the alternative } H_1: F(x)> G(x)}{} 
\deqn{\Delta_{m,n}^{-} = \sup [G_n(t) - F_{m}(x)]W(E_{m+n}(t)), \textnormal{ to test against the alternative } H_1: F(x)< G(x), }{}


where \eqn{E_{m+n}(t)}{} is the empirical cdf of the pooled sample \eqn{(X_{1},..., X_{m},Y_{1},..., Y_{n})}{}, \eqn{W( )}{} is a strictly positive weight function defined on \eqn{[0,1]}{}. 
	
	
	\code{w_vec[i]} (0\eqn{<}{}\code{i}\eqn{<}{}\eqn{m+n}{}) is then equal to \eqn{W(Z_i)=W(\frac{i}{m+n})}{}(\eqn{Z_i}{} is the i-th smallest observation in the pooled sample \eqn{(X_{1},..., X_{m},Y_{1},..., Y_{n})}{}). 
Different value of \code{w\_vec} specifies the weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test differently. For example, when \code{w_vec=rep(1,m+n-1)}, \code{\link{KS2sample_Rcpp}} calculates the p-value of the unweighted two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, when \code{w_vec} = \code{((1:(m+n-1))*((m+n-1):1))^(-1/2)}, it calculates the p-value for the weighted two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Anderson-Darling weight \eqn{W(t) = 1/[t(1-t)]^{1/2}}{}.
	
  Possible values of \code{kind} are 1,2 and 3, which specify the alternative hypothesis, i.e. specify the test statistic to be either \eqn{\Delta_{m,n}}{},  \eqn{\Delta_{m,n}^{+}}{} or \eqn{\Delta_{m,n}^{-}}{} respectively.
 
The numeric array \code{M} specifies the number of \emph{repeated observations} in the pooled sample. Given two data samples \eqn{\{x_{1},..., x_{m}\}}{} and \eqn{\{y_{1},..., y_{n}\}}{}, let there be \eqn{K}{}, \eqn{K\leq }{}\code{m+n}, distinct observation (\eqn{K}{} is the length of the array \code{M}), \eqn{A_1<A_2<\ldots<A_K}{}, in the pooled sample \eqn{\{x_{1},..., x_{m},y_{1},..., y_{n}\}}{} and denote by \eqn{M_i}{} the number of times \eqn{A_i}{} is repeated in the pooled sample (the value of \code{M[i]} = \eqn{M_i}{}), and by \eqn{r_i}{}  and \eqn{l_i}{}  the number of times \eqn{A_i}{} is repeated in the first and second samples respectively. The calculated p-value is the conditional probability:
\deqn{P(D_{m,n}\geq q|M_1=r_1+l_1,\ldots,M_K=r_K+l_k)}{}
	where \eqn{D_{m,n}}{} is the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic \eqn{\Delta_{m,n}}{} specified by the value of \code{w_vec} and \code{kind}, for two samples of sizes \code{m} and \code{n}, \emph{randomly drawn from the pooled sample without replacement}, as before, \code{q} is its observed value of statistic calculated based on the samples \eqn{\{x_{1}, ..., x_{m}\}}{} and \eqn{\{y_{1}, ..., y_{n}\}}{}.

	Note that \eqn{D_{m,n}}{} is defined on the space \eqn{\Omega}{} of all possible \eqn{\frac{(m+n)!}{m!n!}}{}  pairs of samples,  \eqn{(X_1,\ldots,X_m)}{}  and \eqn{(Y_1,\ldots,Y_n)}{}  of sizes \eqn{m}{}  and \eqn{n}{}, with empirical cdfs \eqn{F_m(x)}{}  and \eqn{G_n(x)}{}  respectively, that are randomly drawn without replacement from the pooled sample \eqn{\{x_{1},..., x_{m},y_{1},..., y_{n}\}}{}.
 

	\code{\link{KS2sample_Rcpp}} implements an exact algorithm, extending the Fortran 77 subroutine due to Nikiforov (1994), an extended its functionality by allowing more flexible choice of weight, as well as for \emph{large sample sizes}. This leads to faster computation time, as well as, higher accuracy for very large \code{m} and \code{n}. Compared with other known algorithms, it allows data samples come from \emph{continuous, discrete or mixed distribution}(i.e. ties may appear), and it is more efficient and more generally applicable for \emph{large sample sizes}. This algorithm ensures a total worst-case run-time of order \eqn{O(nm)}{}.

\value{
Numeric value corresponding to \eqn{P(D_{m,n}\geq q|M_1=r_1+l_1,\ldots,M_K=r_K+l_k)}{}, given sample sizes \code{m}, \code{n}, \code{M} and \code{w_vec}. If the value of \code{m}, \code{n} are non-positive, or if the length of \code{w_vec} is not equal to \code{m+n-1}, then the function returns \code{-1}, the non-permitted value of \code{M} or non-permitted value inside \code{w_vec} returns \code{-2}, numerically unstable calculation returns \code{-3}.
