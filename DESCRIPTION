Description: Contains functions to compute p-values for the one-sample and two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests and the two-sample Kuiper test for any fixed critical level and arbitrary (possibly very large) sample sizes. For the one-sample KS test, this package implements a novel, accurate and efficient method named Exact-KS-FFT, which allows the pre-specified cumulative distribution function under the null hypothesis to be continuous, purely discrete or mixed. In the two-sample case, it is assumed that both samples come from an unspecified (unknown) continuous, purely discrete or mixed distribution, i.e. ties (repeated observations) are allowed, and exact p-values of the KS and the Kuiper tests are computed. Note, the two-sample Kuiper test is often used when data samples are on the line or on the circle (circular data).
